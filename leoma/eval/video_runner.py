"""Video-generation king-of-the-hill duel runner.

On the same held-out clips, king and challenger each generate a continuation from
the clip's first frame + prompt using the SAME per-clip seed; each generation is
scored against the real continuation with a reference metric, and the per-clip
distances feed the paired bootstrap verdict.

``run_duel`` is the pure orchestration — it takes *generate* callables and a
*distance* function, so the whole scoring→verdict flow is unit-testable with numpy
fakes. The torch/diffusers loading + generation used in production is imported
lazily (``load_video_pipeline`` / ``generate``); ``duel`` wires those into
``run_duel``.

Two things ``run_duel`` now records that it did not before, both so a disagreement
between validators can be *localized* instead of argued about:

* **per-clip generated-frame digests** — if two validators' distances differ, the
  digests say immediately whether the generations differed (GPU noise) or only the
  scoring did (a broken box);
* **the clip's manifest id**, alongside the index the seed was derived from.

``run_duel`` can also generate king and challenger **concurrently** (``concurrent=
True``): each clip's two generations are independent (same seed, different pipeline),
so on a multi-GPU box they can run on separate devices at the same time instead of
one after the other. This is a throughput setting, not a consensus one — see
``eval/devices.py`` for why, and for the one thing an operator must not forget when
turning it on.
