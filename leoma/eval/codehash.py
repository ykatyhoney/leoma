"""A digest of the scoring code itself.

Pinning the *inputs* to a duel is only half the job. If one eval box is running a
build whose LPIPS wrapper resizes differently, or whose bootstrap draws its
resamples in a different order, it will produce distances nobody else can
reproduce — from provably identical inputs.

``eval_code_digest()`` hashes the modules that can change a distance, plus
``chain.toml``. The validator asks a box for it over ``/health`` **before** handing
it an hours-long duel, and it lands in the verdict's audit block. This does not
prevent a modified box from lying about its own hash — nothing self-reported can.
What it prevents is the far more likely failure: an operator who forgot to redeploy
one machine, silently poisoning consensus for weeks.
