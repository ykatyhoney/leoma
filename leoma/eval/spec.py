"""The consensus surface: every input that can change a verdict, pinned in one place.

A duel must be a **pure function of the chain**. Today it is not: the prompt, the
frame count, the resolution, the metric — all of them come from per-box env vars
and dataclass defaults, so two honest validators can hand the same challenger two
different exams and disagree about who won.

This module is the fix. :class:`ConsensusSpec` is the complete set of duel inputs;
it is built once from ``chain.toml``, hashed into a :meth:`ConsensusSpec.digest`,
sent *explicitly* to the eval server with every request, and **echoed back in the
verdict** so the validator can prove the box actually used it
(:func:`verify_echo`). Anything not in here cannot influence a distance.

Two design rules do the real work:

* **No defaults.** Every field is required. A field with a default is a field a
  validator can silently forget — and forgetting it produces a *plausible* verdict
  that quietly disagrees with everyone else's. Missing field ⇒ loud 422.
* **``extra="forbid"``.** A newer validator sending a field an older box ignores
  would otherwise diverge in silence. Here it is a hard error at the door.
