"""
Validator service for Leoma — king of the hill.

Each permissioned validator independently:
  1. scans the chain's revealed commitments for miner model submissions
     (``reveal_scan``) — no owner-api, no rotation,
  2. duels each new challenger against the reigning king on a GPU eval server
     (deterministic, block-hash-seeded), and
  3. crowns a challenger that wins by a confident margin, then sets equal weights
     across the king + recent prior kings (else burns to UID 0).

Because the duel is deterministic given the chain + reveals, every validator
converges on the same king with no cross-validator coordination. The king state
persists to this validator's own bucket (``state_store``).
