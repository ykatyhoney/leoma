"""Build + publish the public ``dashboard.json`` (Teutonic-style).

The validator has no API, so — like Teutonic — it publishes a single JSON
snapshot to its own bucket that the website polls. This module builds that
payload from the in-memory king state (pure, testable) and writes it to the
bucket. The bucket object must be public-read for the site to fetch it.

Shape (consumed by the leoma-app dashboard):
  updated_at, chain{name,seed_repo,seed_digest,netuid}, duel_params,
  king{hotkey,uid,model_repo,model_digest,reign_number,crowned_at,crowned_block,...},
  king_chain[{...,uid,weight}]   (current king first; weight = equal share, 1/n),
  stats{accepted,rejected,failed},
  queue[{hotkey,uid,model_repo,model_digest,block,status}],
  history[{hotkey,uid,model_repo,verdict,accepted,mu_hat,lcb,...}]  (newest first)
