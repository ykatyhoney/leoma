"""Build, publish and verify the corpus manifest.

This is the offline half of the consensus surface. Everything expensive,
build-dependent or non-deterministic about choosing duel clips happens **here,
once**, and its results are frozen into a file whose digest goes into
``chain.toml``. At duel time nothing is detected, searched or listed.

What moves offline, and what that buys:

* **scene detection** — ffmpeg's scene-cut timestamps vary by build. Deciding the
  clip window once and recording it as ``clip_start`` means two validators can no
  longer carve a different five seconds out of the same video.
* **the "is this video usable" question** — a video too short to hold a clip, or
  with no single-shot window, used to be discovered *at duel time* and silently
  skipped, shifting every subsequent index. It is a property of the video, so it
  is decided here and the video simply never enters the list.
* **the ground truth itself** — decoded and hashed, so a validator whose ffmpeg
  produces different pixels finds out immediately instead of silently scoring
  against different reality.
* **static clips** — dropped by ``motion_energy``, because the freeze cheat only
  pays on clips that barely move. Remove the surface rather than only detecting
  the attack.

Building requires read access to the source bucket and a working ffmpeg. Verifying
requires the same, and is what an operator runs on a **new eval box** before it is
allowed to duel: it proves this box decodes the pinned corpus byte-identically.
