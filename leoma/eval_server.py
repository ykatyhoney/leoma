"""FastAPI eval server for the video king-of-the-hill duel.

The validator POSTs a duel (king vs challenger, both by immutable ``repo@digest``)
and streams progress + the final verdict. One duel runs at a time (global lock):
the GPU box downloads both models, generates on the deterministic held-out clips,
scores against the ground-truth continuations, and returns the paired-bootstrap
verdict.

The heavy work is a pluggable *runner* (``create_app(runner=...)``) so the HTTP
contract, the single-flight lock, the event log and the watchdog are unit-testable
with a fake runner and no GPU.

**Why this file is defensive out of proportion to its size:** it holds the only GPU
in the subnet behind a single global lock, and a duel takes hours. Every way that
lock could be held forever is a way to halt the subnet — no crowns, no progress, a
permanent 409 — and the failure looks *exactly* like "we're busy". Three invariants
carry the weight:

* **The lock is always released.** Once, and only once, on every path — success,
  exception, cancellation, watchdog kill, or a failure to even start the thread.
* **Exactly one terminal event, always.** Every job ends in exactly one of
  ``verdict`` / ``error`` / ``cancelled``. A stream that ends without one used to be
  indistinguishable from a busy server, so a *broken* duel read as "try again later"
  — forever.
* **Progress is watched, not wall-clock.** A flat timeout has to guess how long a
  14B video duel takes; guess low and you kill healthy work, guess high and a hung
  socket wedges the box for an hour. The watchdog instead asks "is it still making
  forward progress?", which the duel already tells us, clip by clip.

The hard-kill fallback (``os._exit``) is only defensible because **the chain is the
queue**: the validator re-derives its work list from on-chain reveals every tick, so
a restart costs exactly one duel, which comes back for free.
